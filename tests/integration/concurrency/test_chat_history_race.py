"""Regression test for the per-``conversation_id`` lock for serial follow-ups.

``ChatAPI.ask`` rebuilds the conversation history from
``ChatAPI._cache`` at the top of the request, then ``await``s
the streamed POST, then writes the new turn back to the cache. Two
concurrent ``ask`` calls on the *same* ``conversation_id`` interleave at
the ``await`` — both read the SAME pre-update history, both POST the
exact same prior-turn context, and the second cache-write overwrites
no-op (it appends, but the server-side turn lineage is already corrupted
because Google saw two follow-ups both claiming to be turn N+1).

Post-fix: ``ChatAPI`` holds a per-``conversation_id`` ``asyncio.Lock``
from history-build through cache-append. Two concurrent follow-ups on
the same conversation_id serialize; the second sees the first's cached
turn in its outgoing history payload.

Acceptance invariant:
  seed conversation ``cid`` with one Q/A turn; fire
  ``gather(ask("q2", conversation_id=cid), ask("q3", conversation_id=cid))``
  against a transport that delays each response so both requests overlap;
  assert that ONE of the two outgoing requests carries the OTHER turn's
  Q/A pair in its ``conversation_history``. Pre-fix both would carry
  only the seed turn (length 2 = 1 Q + 1 A); post-fix the second to run
  carries seed + first-follow-up (length 4 = 2 Q + 2 A).
