"""Regression test for the event-loop affinity guard.

Audit item §14 (`thread-safety-concurrency-audit.md` §14):
Pre-fix, ``Session`` carried asyncio primitives (``_reqid_lock``,
``_refresh_lock``, the underlying ``httpx.AsyncClient``'s connection
pool, and any spawned ``asyncio.Task``s) that are silently bound to
whichever event loop was current when they were constructed or first
awaited. A caller who instantiates a client under ``asyncio.run(...)``
in one thread and then hands it to another thread's loop hits opaque
``RuntimeError: ... is bound to a different event loop`` deep inside
httpx, or — worse — a hang on a never-acquired lock that belongs to
a dead loop.

Post-fix: ``Session.open()`` captures
``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` in ``self.bound_loop`` and
``_perform_authed_post`` asserts the running loop matches via a cheap
``is`` comparison. On mismatch we raise an actionable ``RuntimeError``
at the call site instead of letting the failure escalate into the
httpx pool or asyncio.Lock internals.

The test exercises the surgical contract:

1. **Cross-loop use raises early** — open the core under one loop, then
   call ``rpc_call`` (which routes through ``_perform_authed_post``)
   under a *different* loop and assert the loop-affinity ``RuntimeError``
   surfaces with the documented message. The error must come from G2's
   guard, not from a downstream httpx symptom.
2. **Same-loop use is unaffected** — open + dispatch under one loop and
   confirm 100 fan-out calls succeed (no false positive on the
   ``is`` comparison).
3. **No binding before open()** — a freshly-constructed ``Session``
   that has never been ``open()``ed has ``bound_loop is None``; we
   only check inside ``_perform_authed_post`` which already asserts
   ``self._kernel.http_client is not None``, so an "unopened client" caller
   sees the existing assertion error, not the loop guard.

Why this lives under ``tests/integration/concurrency/`` and not
``tests/unit/``: the regression requires a real ``httpx.AsyncClient``
that has actually been opened, so we reuse the ``ConcurrentMockTransport``
swap-in pattern documented in ``test_harness_smoke.py``. The fix
itself is a one-line ``is`` comparison — but verifying it requires
two distinct event loops, which is integration-shaped.
