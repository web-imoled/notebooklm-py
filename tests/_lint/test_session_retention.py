"""Meta-lint: every ``Session`` method must be listed in the retention doc.

Pairs with [`docs/session-method-retention.md`](../../docs/session-method-retention.md).
AST-parses [`src/notebooklm/_session.py`](../../src/notebooklm/_session.py),
enumerates every method / property defined inside the ``Session`` class body,
and asserts each one appears in the retention table with a valid disposition.

Adding a new method to ``Session`` without a corresponding row in the doc
fails this lint at PR time — the retention doc is the single source of truth
for the post-Wave-11 ``Session`` shape.

Lint shape (modeled after :mod:`tests._lint.test_no_session_compat_bridges`
and :mod:`tests._lint.test_no_core_imports`):

* True AST parse — no regex against the source.
* Enumerates :class:`ast.FunctionDef` + :class:`ast.AsyncFunctionDef` nodes
  whose immediate parent is the ``Session`` class body. Properties
  (``@property``-decorated functions) are included; nested functions inside
  methods are NOT (the parent walk gates them out).
* The doc parser scans the inventory table for rows shaped
  ``| `method_name` | category | disposition |``. Method names appear
  inside the first backtick-pair of column one; the entire backtick token
  may also carry a ``(property)`` suffix (e.g. ``kernel`` (property)).
* The only valid disposition is ``retain — <reason>``. Wave 11c tightened
  the lint to its **final form** when the three sub-wave cluster
  deletions (11a + 11b + 11c) had all landed: the transitional
  ``delete in Wave 11 (<cluster>)`` disposition that Wave 10 introduced
  to schedule the cluster deletions is no longer accepted; the rows
  that carried it moved to the **Deleted** section at the bottom of
  the retention doc (which the parser scopes out).

The lint enumerates methods only — not instance attributes like
``Session._rate_limit_max_retries`` (those are assigned in ``__init__`` and
documented in the "Stage-A and Rule-4 attribute capture targets" section of
the retention doc for context).
