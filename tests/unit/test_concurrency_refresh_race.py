"""Snapshot-invariant for the shared POST helper.

httpx merges the cookie jar into the outgoing ``httpx.Request`` synchronously
in ``build_request()``, before any ``await``. ``_perform_authed_post`` reads
the auth snapshot (via ``self._snapshot()``) and assembles ``(url, body,
headers)`` via ``build_request(snapshot)`` synchronously before
``await client.post(...)``. Therefore, within a single retry iteration the
entire ``(csrf, session_id, cookies)`` snapshot is atomic from a concurrent
coroutine standpoint: no other task can mutate state between read and the
wire.

The POST was extracted out of ``_rpc_call_impl`` into
``_perform_authed_post`` so chat can share the same transport pipeline.
The AST guard below follows the POST; the invariant still belongs at the
shared site.

The auth-snapshot lock hardened the invariant by:

- making ``_snapshot()`` ``async def`` and acquiring a dedicated
  ``_auth_snapshot_lock`` for the read, so the four scalar fields
  (``csrf_token``/``session_id``/``authuser``/``account_email``) are
  observed atomically with respect to ``refresh_auth``'s
  write-block; and
- refactoring ``_build_url()`` to consume the resulting
  ``_AuthSnapshot`` rather than reading ``self.auth`` LIVE — that
  prior live-read was the actual torn-read hazard, since it let a
  refresh's write to ``self.auth.session_id`` slip into the URL between
  snapshot capture and request build.

This file *locks* the invariant in three ways:

1. ``test_perform_authed_post_has_no_await_before_post_per_iteration`` —
   static AST guard against an ``await`` inside the retry loop's try
   body of ``_perform_authed_post`` that precedes the iteration's
   ``client.post(...)`` call. The ``await self._snapshot()`` lives
   *before* the try block (so the lock acquisition itself isn't a
   regression).

2. ``test_build_url_does_not_read_self_auth`` — static AST guard
   against any ``self.auth.<field>`` attribute access in
   ``RpcExecutor.build_url``. The method MUST consume only its
   ``snapshot: _AuthSnapshot`` parameter; reverting to ``self.auth``
   would silently un-do the atomicity fix.

3. ``test_concurrent_refresh_does_not_corrupt_inflight_rpc_request`` —
   runtime self-consistency. Drives concurrent ``refresh_auth`` against
   an in-flight ``rpc_call`` (both orderings) and asserts the captured
   ``httpx.Request`` is never observed with mixed-generation (csrf,
   session_id, cookies) state.

    """No ``await`` may sit lexically inside the ``try:`` block before the
    ``client.post(...)`` call in ``_perform_authed_post``.

    The leaf begins with ``snapshot = await self._snapshot()`` + a
    synchronous ``build_request(snapshot)`` — both immediately *before*
    the try block. The try body's first statement is the actual POST. If
    anyone introduces an ``await`` between ``build_request`` and the POST
    (or any new await inside the try body's prologue), a concurrent
    ``refresh_auth`` could update the httpx cookie jar between the
    snapshot read and the wire, producing a mismatched-generation
    request on the cookie axis (the ``_auth_snapshot_lock`` covers
    csrf/sid coherence; cookies still rely on this no-await rule).

    Tier-12 PRs 12.7 / 12.8 lifted retry / auth-refresh out of the leaf
    into ``RetryMiddleware`` and ``AuthRefreshMiddleware``. After PR
    12.8 the leaf no longer has a ``while`` retry loop — it makes
    exactly one attempt per chain invocation. Each chain-level retry
    (driven by ``RetryMiddleware`` / ``AuthRefreshMiddleware``) re-enters
    the leaf and re-runs ``_snapshot`` → ``build_request`` → POST. PR
    12.9 moved the semaphore acquire OUT of the leaf entirely (it now
    lives in ``SemaphoreMiddleware`` at chain position 2), so the leaf
