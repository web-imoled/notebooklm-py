"""Unit tests for :mod:`notebooklm._session_lifecycle`.

Covers the load-bearing behaviors of :class:`ClientLifecycle` directly, in
addition to the existing ``Session``-shaped tests in
``test_session_close.py`` / ``test_client_keepalive.py`` / ``test_vcr_config.py``
which exercise the same helper through the compat facade.

Specifically pinned here:

* :meth:`ClientLifecycle.open` is **idempotent** — a second call while the
  client is already open is a no-op (the first ``httpx.AsyncClient`` instance
  is preserved).
* :meth:`ClientLifecycle.close` **cancels and awaits the keepalive task
  cleanly** — the task exits and is set to ``None``; the call doesn't leak a
  ``CancelledError``.
* ``_bound_loop`` **mismatch raises ``RuntimeError``** — the cross-loop guard
  in :class:`AuthedTransport` reads ``_bound_loop`` through the lifecycle and
  raises actionably when the loops differ.
* :meth:`ClientLifecycle.save_cookies` **invokes** the host's
  ``cookie_persistence.save`` collaborator with the right ``jar`` and
  ``path`` arguments AND with the ``save_cookies_to_storage`` value resolved
  from ``notebooklm._core`` at call time (so the monkeypatch surface keeps
  working).
* The httpx ``AsyncClient`` **always uses httpx's default transport** —
  Tier-12 PR 12.6 lifted synthetic-error injection into the chain
  (:class:`notebooklm._middleware_error_injection.ErrorInjectionMiddleware`)
  and PR 12.9 deleted the legacy ``_SyntheticErrorTransport`` class.
  The lifecycle constructs a plain transport regardless of
  ``NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD_ERRORS``.
* :meth:`ClientLifecycle._keepalive_loop` **respects the min-interval
  clamp** — ``_resolve_keepalive_interval`` floors the configured interval
  at ``keepalive_min_interval`` so a sub-floor user value gets bumped up.

Tests are intentionally helper-shaped (instantiate :class:`ClientLifecycle`
directly with a Protocol-conformant stub host) so they cover the lifecycle
without taking on a ``Session`` dependency.

#
# 3. ``ClientLifecycle.__init__`` wires the defaults when ``cookie_saver`` /
#    ``cookie_rotator`` are ``None`` (or omitted), and accepts custom
#    callables when supplied. The ``or _default_*`` resolution pattern is
