"""Integration tests for the empty middleware chain wired into ``Session``.

PR 12.2 of the Tier-12/13 greenfield migration wires
:func:`notebooklm._middleware.build_chain` into
:meth:`Session.__init__` with an empty middleware list. The chain leaf
(:meth:`Session._authed_post_chain_terminal`) reads
``build_request`` / ``log_label`` / ``disable_internal_retries`` from
``RpcRequest.context`` and delegates to
:meth:`AuthedTransport.perform_authed_post` — the shared seam covering both
:meth:`Session._perform_authed_post` AND ``RpcExecutor.execute`` (which
calls ``self._owner._perform_authed_post`` at ``_rpc_executor.py:275``).

These tests verify the wiring contract from ADR-009
§"RpcRequest.context keys":

1. Both call paths (``Session._perform_authed_post`` directly and
   ``RpcExecutor.execute`` indirectly) flow through the empty chain to the
   transport.
2. ``RpcRequest.context`` carries ``build_request`` / ``log_label`` /
   ``disable_internal_retries`` exactly as the leaf expects them.
3. The leaf returns an :class:`RpcResponse` wrapping the
   :class:`httpx.Response` from the transport.

The terminal adapter resolves ``self._get_authed_transport()`` per
invocation so swapping the transport mid-test (the idiom used here) still
affects live behavior — a property the existing
``test_authed_transport.py`` test suite already relies on for its
monkeypatch surface.
