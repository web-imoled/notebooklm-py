"""Regression test for the close-cancellation transport-leak shield.

The audit covered whether the ``asyncio.shield`` wrapped around
``self._kernel.http_client.aclose()`` inside :meth:`notebooklm._session.Session.close`
correctly survives a cancellation that lands while ``aclose`` itself is
in flight, exercised through the user-facing ``__aexit__`` surface (not
the bare ``close()`` task path already covered by the companion
``test_cancel_mid_close_does_not_leak_transport``).

The shield itself ships earlier (PR #526, sha ``d8b5bd6``). The
follow-up acceptance criterion was a complementary repro that exercises
a different cancel-injection site:

- Client opened with ``keepalive=...`` so a background poke task is alive
  and the close sequence has to drive a real keepalive teardown.
- ``_rotate_cookies`` monkeypatched to hang on an unset ``asyncio.Event``
  so the keepalive task is genuinely parked when close starts cancelling
  it. CancelledError is intentionally NOT trapped — the keepalive task
  must remain cancellable so that ``_core.close()`` can tear it down and
  reach the shielded ``aclose`` block.
- The httpx client's ``aclose`` is also monkeypatched to insert a short
  ``await asyncio.sleep(0.2)`` so the close path doesn't run to
  completion in microseconds; otherwise the outer ``wait_for`` timeout
  would never fire and the cancel-during-aclose path the shield
  protects would never be exercised.
- ``__aexit__`` driven through :func:`asyncio.wait_for(timeout=0.1)` so
  the outer cancel reliably arrives while the slowed ``aclose`` is in
  flight — i.e. inside the shielded await.
- We hold a reference to ``client._session._kernel.http_client`` captured before
  the cancel (close nulls the attribute on success) and assert
  ``http_client_ref.is_closed`` is true afterwards — proof that the
  shielded ``aclose`` in the outer ``finally`` ran to completion.

The shield satisfies this invariant; the follow-up source change was
intentionally a no-op (the audit's job was to confirm the shield is
positioned correctly, which it is). This test is the regression
artifact — verified to fail loudly when the shield is removed (the
cancelled-mid-``aclose`` path then leaves ``is_closed=False``).
