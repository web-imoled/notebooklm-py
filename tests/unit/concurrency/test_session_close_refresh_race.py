"""Regression tests for the close-cancels-refresh-task contract (P0-1).

Before P0-1, ``ClientLifecycle.close`` cancelled the keepalive task and
drained the poll registry but did NOT cancel ``host._auth_coord._refresh_task``.
A slow refresh racing against ``close()`` would survive the shielded
``aclose()`` — the task kept holding the now-closed ``httpx.AsyncClient``
and surfaced as a confusing ``RuntimeError`` from inside httpx, or as a
lingering coroutine that pytest's
"coroutine was never awaited" detector flagged at GC time.

The fix is a small block in :meth:`ClientLifecycle.close` between
keepalive teardown and ``save_cookies``:

    if host._auth_coord._refresh_task and not host._auth_coord._refresh_task.done():
        host._auth_coord._refresh_task.cancel()
        await asyncio.gather(host._auth_coord._refresh_task, return_exceptions=True)

That block:
1. Cancels the in-flight refresh task so the shared single-flight refresh
   wave unwinds cleanly.
2. Awaits the cancellation via ``gather(..., return_exceptions=True)`` so
   ``CancelledError`` does not propagate out of ``close()``.
3. Sits BEFORE the cookie save / shielded aclose so the refresh callback
   never observes a half-closed transport.

These tests exercise both the cancel and the no-cancel-needed paths.
