"""Static AST checks enforcing the ADR-008 ``cli/services`` layering boundary.

This file scans cleaned ``cli/services`` modules for forbidden imports —
top-level ``click`` and relative imports from sibling presentation/runtime
modules (``..rendering``, ``..error_handler``, ``..runtime``). It also
inventories the Stage-3 transitional exceptions for workflow services still
being migrated out of rendering/exit ownership.

Scope: every file under ``cli/services/`` (recursively, excluding
``__init__.py`` and ``__pycache__``) must be classified into exactly one of
three sets:

* ``GUARDED_PATHS`` — fully cleaned modules. ``_boundary_violations`` must
  return an empty list AND the module must have no Pattern A
  ``console.print`` + ``exit_with_code`` co-occurrence.
* ``TRANSITIONAL_GUARDED_PATHS`` — modules still owning some presentation or
  exit policy that the architecture plan moves back to the command layer.
  Each entry declares its exact current violations (``forbidden_imports``
  list + ``pattern_a_violations`` list of ``(function_name, line)`` tuples).
  Removing a violation in a refactor PR must update the declaration in the
  same PR; adding one is rejected outright by the tests below.
* ``WAIVED_PATHS`` — modules with a documented, indefinite exception (e.g.
  Click parser-time callbacks where ``raise click.BadParameter`` is the
  contract Click itself defines). Empty by default; entries require an
  explicit rationale.

The ``test_inventory_completeness`` test enforces the partition: every
service module must appear in exactly one set. New modules added under
``cli/services/`` will fail the test until classified.

Pattern A definition: ``console.print`` and ``exit_with_code`` co-occur as
Pattern A iff both are called from within the SAME
``ast.FunctionDef | ast.AsyncFunctionDef`` body (at any nesting depth inside
that function, but NOT crossing into a nested ``FunctionDef`` /
``AsyncFunctionDef``). The implementation in :func:`_pattern_a_pairs`
reports one pair per ``exit_with_code`` call site so that line drift after
a refactor elsewhere is caught — silent shifts (e.g. an unrelated edit
moving the line) would otherwise mask a real regression.
