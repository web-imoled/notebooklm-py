"""Static AST checks enforcing the ADR-008 ``cli/services`` layering boundary.

This file scans ``cli/services/listing.py`` for forbidden imports — top-level
``click`` and relative imports from sibling presentation/runtime modules
(``..rendering``, ``..error_handler``, ``..runtime``).

Scope: only ``cli/services/listing.py`` is enforced here. The audit (I0) also
flagged ``cli/services/login.py``, but between the audit and this PR landing,
PR #954 split that file into the ``cli/services/login/`` package and the
``console.print`` / Click cleanup was explicitly deferred at that point (per
PR #954's source-plan overrides). Adding the ``login/`` package to this guard
is the job of a follow-up PR; doing it here would gate a passing PR-C on
unrelated ~1500-2000 lines of refactor work.

The guard is a single source of truth — to extend it to the ``login/``
package, add the module paths to ``GUARDED_PATHS`` and the existing
``test_login_package_boundary`` skeleton becomes the entry point. The two
helper functions below stay agnostic of which file is being scanned.
