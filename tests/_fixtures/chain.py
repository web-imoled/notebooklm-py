"""Test fixtures for the Tier-12 middleware chain.

These fixtures land in PR 12.1 so every subsequent middleware PR (12.3–12.8)
has a uniform test substrate. Each new middleware extraction can express its
unit tests as "build a chain with [..., FakeMiddleware(), ...], call it, assert
behaviour" without re-inventing the chain plumbing per PR.

Three helpers live here:

- :class:`FakeAuthedPost` — programmable stub matching the shape of
  :meth:`notebooklm._authed_transport.AuthedTransport.perform_authed_post`. This
  is **not** ``FakeKernel`` — the ``Kernel`` Protocol doesn't exist until
  PR 13.2, and renaming to ``FakeKernel`` is part of PR 13.2's scope. Until
  then, the terminal call still goes through ``AuthedTransport``.
- :func:`make_request` — factory for :class:`notebooklm._middleware.RpcRequest`
  instances with benign defaults. Tests override only the fields they care
  about via keyword arguments.
- :func:`chain_calls_through_to_authed_post` — assertion helper that builds
  a chain over a :class:`FakeAuthedPost` terminal, invokes it once, and
  returns whether the underlying ``perform_authed_post`` was called. The
  helper is the canonical answer to "did this set of middlewares actually
  wire up so the request reaches the transport?" and is used by every
  middleware PR's wire-up smoke test.

See ``docs/adr/0009-middleware-chain.md`` for the chain contract and
``docs/refactor-history.md`` for the migration sequence.

    """Programmable stub for ``AuthedTransport.perform_authed_post``.

    Matches the production callable's keyword-only signature (``build_request``,
    ``log_label``, ``disable_internal_retries``) so a terminal that adapts
    :class:`RpcRequest` into a transport call can target this fake without
    branching on "is this a real transport or a fake."

    Records every call into :attr:`calls` (a list of ``dict`` snapshots) so
    tests can assert both *that* the transport was reached and *what*
    arguments arrived. The default return is a minimal
    :class:`httpx.Response` with status 200 and an empty body (no attached
    ``.request``, unlike the production buffered response from
    ``stream_post_with_size_cap``) — enough for middlewares that just
    observe and pass through.

    Override the return value by setting :attr:`response` (single fixed
    response) or :attr:`response_factory` (callable producing per-call
    responses). If :attr:`raises` is set, the call raises that exception
    instead.

    ``build_request`` / ``log_label`` / ``disable_internal_retries`` from

    12.3–12.8: extracts a middleware, asserts
    ``chain_calls_through_to_authed_post(fake_transport, [new_middleware])
    is True``. A short-circuiting middleware (one that returns without
    calling ``next_call``) is the only legitimate way for this to return
    ``False``; in the Tier-12 set, no production middleware does that.
