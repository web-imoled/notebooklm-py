"""Private note-row primitives — classifier + CRUD.

This module owns the backend note-row operations shared by ``NotesAPI``
(plain notes + saved-from-chat notes) and ``ArtifactsAPI`` (mind maps,
which the server stores in the same note collection). It deliberately
sits *below* both feature facades so neither has to import the other,
and so the mind-map adapter (``_mind_map.NoteBackedMindMapService``)
has a single seam to delegate through.

``NoteRowKind`` is a private classification of the raw row shapes
returned by the ``GET_NOTES_AND_MIND_MAPS`` RPC. It is intentionally
NOT part of the public ``notebooklm`` surface — the public ``Note``
dataclass and ``client.notes`` / ``client.artifacts`` facades remain
the only stable contract.

Risk-mitigation note (refactor-history.md §Risks): saved-chat note metadata is
not always reliably present on the wire. When the classifier cannot
positively identify a row as a saved-from-chat note it defaults to
``NOTE`` (not ``UNKNOWN``) so the NotesAPI list path keeps surfacing
the row — losing a chat-mode tag is preferable to dropping the note.

# Module-level strong-ref anchor for fire-and-forget cleanup tasks (RUF006).
# ``asyncio.create_task`` returns a Task that the event loop only holds via a
# weak reference, so an unrooted Task can be garbage-collected mid-execution —
# losing the orphan-row cleanup the cancel-safety shield is supposed to
# guarantee. Each created task adds itself here and removes itself in a
# done-callback so the set stays bounded.
#
# Intentionally module-level (not per-instance): the cleanup tasks are
# detached fire-and-forget work whose only purpose is to keep the loop's
# Task storage from GC-ing them mid-flight. Sharing one set across all
# ``NoteService`` instances is correct and simpler than per-instance
# bookkeeping — there is no per-instance state on the tasks themselves.
# Audit CC6: single-loop-per-client invariant per ADR-004; not safe for multi-loop fan-out.
