"""HTTP-client lifecycle helper for :class:`Session`.

Owns the session-side open/close ordering that historically lived inline on
``Session`` while delegating the raw HTTP transport to
:class:`notebooklm._kernel.Kernel`:

* ``_http_client`` — compatibility property backed by the concrete Kernel's
  live ``httpx.AsyncClient`` (or ``None`` when closed).
* ``_bound_loop`` — the event loop ``open()`` ran on; the cross-loop affinity
  guard in :meth:`Session._perform_authed_post` (via
  :class:`AuthedTransport`) compares against this captured reference.
* ``_keepalive_task`` — the optional background task that pokes
  ``accounts.google.com/RotateCookies`` while the client is open.
* ``_keepalive_interval`` / ``_keepalive_storage_path`` — keepalive
  configuration; the interval is clamped against ``keepalive_min_interval``
  via :func:`notebooklm._session_helpers._resolve_keepalive_interval`.
* ``_timeout`` / ``_connect_timeout`` / ``_limits`` — HTTP timeouts and
  connection-pool tuning consumed in :meth:`open`.

Design constraints (load-bearing — see ``tests/unit/test_client_keepalive.py``,
``tests/unit/test_session_close.py``, ``tests/unit/test_vcr_config.py``, and
``tests/unit/test_auth_cookie_save_race.py``):

* ``__init__`` MUST be event-loop-agnostic. ``Session`` is routinely
  constructed outside a running loop (sync-mode ``NotebookLMClient(auth)``
  before ``asyncio.run``), so this helper may not call
  ``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` or instantiate any ``asyncio.*`` primitive
  at construction time. The keepalive task is spawned inside :meth:`open`,
  which runs from a coroutine.

* :meth:`open` is idempotent — calling it twice with a live ``_http_client``
  is a no-op, preserving the legacy ``Session.open()`` contract.

* :meth:`close` cancellation ordering: stop keepalive → run registered drain
  hooks → save cookies → shielded Kernel ``aclose()``. Reversing any of these
  reintroduces the leak modes ``test_session_close.py`` pins down. The shielded
  ``aclose()`` is critical: without it, a ``CancelledError`` arriving
  mid-close leaks the underlying httpx transport.

* :meth:`open` no longer wraps the inner transport for synthetic-error
  injection — Tier-12 PR 12.6 lifted that path into the chain
  (:class:`notebooklm._middleware_error_injection.ErrorInjectionMiddleware`,
  wired by :class:`Session.__init__`). When
  ``NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD_ERRORS`` is set, the chain middleware
  short-circuits before the chain leaf reaches httpx, so the httpx-layer
  transport stays a real, unwrapped transport at all times.

* :meth:`save_cookies` forwards the lifecycle's ``_cookie_saver`` wrapper
  (``_default_cookie_saver`` by default) to ``CookiePersistence._save``;
  the wrapper late-binds ``save_cookies_to_storage`` from
  ``notebooklm._auth.storage`` at call time so a ``monkeypatch.setattr``
  on the canonical seam keeps affecting the live save path.

* ``_bound_loop`` is bound exactly once per :meth:`open` call; :meth:`close`
  does NOT unbind so an accidental cross-loop call after close still raises
  actionably rather than silently re-binding on the next ``open``. (See
  ``tests/integration/concurrency/test_cross_loop_affinity.py``.)

Field names (``_http_client``, ``_bound_loop``, ``_keepalive_task``,
``_keepalive_interval``, ``_keepalive_storage_path``, ``_timeout``,
``_connect_timeout``, ``_limits``) historically mirrored the legacy
``Session`` ivars when ``Session`` still held ``@property`` bridges that
forwarded to them. Those bridges were retired in the session-shrink arc
(see ``tests/_lint/test_no_session_compat_bridges.py`` and the
"closed for the property-shim debt" note in ``docs/architecture.md``);
the names are kept verbatim now for grep discoverability across the test
suite — callers reach the storage directly via ``session._lifecycle.<attr>``
or the public ``session.bound_loop`` property. ``_http_client`` is a thin
accessor returning the live ``httpx.AsyncClient`` from the concrete Kernel.
