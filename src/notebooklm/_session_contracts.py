"""Type-only contracts shared across feature APIs.

This module defines the narrow structural Protocols feature APIs depend
on. Per ADR-013, a Protocol lives here only when **shared by ≥2
features**; single-consumer capabilities (e.g. artifact polling's
``register_drain_hook``) stay local to their owning feature module.

Contents:

* :class:`AuthMetadata` and :class:`Kernel` — selected-account routing
  metadata + pure transport surface consumed by the upload pipeline.
* :class:`RpcCaller`, :class:`LoopGuard`, :class:`OperationScopeProvider`,
  :class:`AsyncWorkRuntime` — the four shared capability Protocols
  promoted in Phase 1 of the capability refactor.

The broad ``Session`` Protocol that previously bundled all of these
together was deleted in Phase 7 (refactor-history.md §Migration Plan step 10).
Feature APIs that need more than one capability take their direct
collaborators by keyword-only constructor argument (``ChatAPI`` in
``_chat.py``, ``ArtifactsAPI`` in ``_artifacts.py``, and
``SourceUploadPipeline`` in ``_source_upload.py``). The feature-local
composite Protocols ``ArtifactsRuntime`` and ``UploadRuntime`` (and
their corresponding adapter dataclasses) that previously bundled three
capability Protocols apiece were retired once it was clear they only
hid three stable collaborators with exactly one production satisfier;
the surviving narrow Protocols (``RpcCaller``, ``LoopGuard``,
``OperationScopeProvider``, ``AsyncWorkRuntime``) here continue to
describe the per-capability shapes feature constructors consume.
