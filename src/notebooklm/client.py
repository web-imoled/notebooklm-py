"""NotebookLM API Client - Main entry point.

This module provides the NotebookLMClient class, a modern async client
for interacting with Google NotebookLM using undocumented RPC APIs.

Example:
    async with await NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
        # List notebooks
        notebooks = await client.notebooks.list()

        # Add sources
        source = await client.sources.add_url(notebook_id, "https://example.com")

        # Generate artifacts
        status = await client.artifacts.generate_audio(notebook_id)
        await client.artifacts.wait_for_completion(notebook_id, status.task_id)

        # Chat with the notebook
        result = await client.chat.ask(notebook_id, "What is this about?")

        Args:
            auth: Authentication tokens from browser login.
            timeout: HTTP request timeout in seconds. Defaults to 30 seconds.
            storage_path: Path to the storage state file for loading download cookies.
            keepalive: Optional interval in seconds for a background task that
                pokes ``accounts.google.com`` while the client is open, eliciting
                ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` rotation so long-lived clients (e.g. agents,
                long-running workers) don't silently stale out. ``None`` (default)
                disables the task — preserving existing CLI semantics. Values
                below ``keepalive_min_interval`` are clamped up to that floor.
            keepalive_min_interval: Lower bound for ``keepalive`` (defaults to
                60 s) to avoid accidentally rate-limiting Google's identity
                surface.
            rate_limit_max_retries: Max automatic retries on HTTP 429.
                Defaults to ``3`` so programmatic users
                inherit "smart retry" behavior out of the box. Set to ``0``
                to raise ``RateLimitError`` immediately.
                Sleeps for ``Retry-After`` when the server provides a
                parseable header; otherwise falls back to capped exponential
                backoff ``min(2 ** attempt, 30)`` seconds with ±20% jitter.
                See :class:`Session` for full sleep semantics.
            server_error_max_retries: Max automatic retries for retryable
                transient failures: HTTP 5xx and network-layer
                ``httpx.RequestError`` (timeouts, connect errors). Defaults to
                ``3``. Uses exponential backoff ``min(2 ** attempt, 30)``
                seconds. Set to ``0`` to disable.
            limits: HTTP connection-pool tuning (``ConnectionLimits``). ``None``
                (default) uses ``ConnectionLimits()`` defaults sized for typical
                batchexecute fan-out (max_connections=100,
                max_keepalive_connections=50, keepalive_expiry=30.0s). Widen
                for heavy batch workloads (FastAPI/Django services sharing one
                client across many concurrent requests).
            max_concurrent_uploads: Ceiling on simultaneous in-flight
                ``client.sources.add_file`` uploads. Defaults to ``4``. Each
                in-flight upload holds one open file descriptor for the
                duration of the upload, so the cap doubles as an
                FD-exhaustion guard against fan-out callers that would
                otherwise open dozens of files concurrently and exhaust
                the per-process FD limit. ``None``
                resolves to the default — unbounded uploads are
                intentionally rejected. Must be ``>= 1`` when supplied.
                Independent of the RPC pool sizing (uploads use their own
                ``httpx.AsyncClient`` against the Scotty endpoint and
                don't share the RPC connection pool).
            max_concurrent_rpcs: Ceiling on simultaneous in-flight RPC
                POSTs (``client.notebooks.list``, ``client.chat.ask``,
                etc.). Defaults to ``16`` — well below the default
                ``ConnectionLimits.max_connections=100`` so short-lived
                helper requests (auth refresh GETs, upload preflights)
                still have pool headroom. Pass ``None`` to disable the
                gate entirely; useful when an external rate-limiter is
                in front of the client or for single-shot CLI commands
                where the throttle is overhead. Must be ``>= 1`` when
                supplied, and must satisfy ``max_concurrent_rpcs <=
                limits.max_connections`` — the constructor raises
                ``ValueError`` otherwise (a semaphore that lets requests
                through that the pool can't fulfill would surface as
                opaque ``httpx.PoolTimeout`` rather than clean
                back-pressure). Before this gate was added, heavy
                fan-out workloads tripped pool timeouts before any
                upstream throttle could intervene.
            upload_timeout: Optional override for the ``httpx.Timeout`` used
                by the resumable-upload start handshake and the finalize
                POST in ``client.sources.add_file``. ``None`` (default)
                preserves the original hardcoded values (10.0s connect /
                60.0s read for start; 10.0s connect / 300.0s read for
                finalize). The supplied ``Timeout`` is used wholesale at
                both upload sites — specify all components explicitly
                (e.g. ``httpx.Timeout(10.0, read=600.0)``), or partial
                fields will fall back to httpx's own 5.0s defaults rather
                than the original 10.0s connect. Defaults are NOT changed
                silently for back-compat.
            on_rpc_event: Optional sync or async callback invoked after each
                logical RPC succeeds or fails. The callback receives a
                backend-agnostic ``RpcTelemetryEvent`` so applications can
                forward telemetry to logging, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, or
                another metrics backend without this package depending on one.

        """Create a client from Playwright storage state file.

        This is the recommended way to create a client for programmatic use.
        Handles all authentication setup automatically.

        Args:
            path: Path to storage_state.json. If provided, takes precedence over profile.
            timeout: HTTP request timeout in seconds. Defaults to 30 seconds.
            profile: Profile name to load auth from (e.g., "work", "personal").
                If None, uses the active profile (from CLI flag, env var, or config).
            keepalive: Optional interval in seconds for the background SIDTS
                rotation poke. ``None`` disables it (default). See
                :class:`NotebookLMClient` for full semantics.
            keepalive_min_interval: Floor for ``keepalive`` (defaults to 60 s).
            rate_limit_max_retries: Max automatic retries on HTTP 429.
                Defaults to ``3``. Set to ``0`` to
                restore raise-immediately behavior. See
                :class:`NotebookLMClient` for full sleep semantics.
            server_error_max_retries: Max automatic retries for HTTP 5xx /
                network errors with exponential backoff. Defaults to ``3``.
            limits: HTTP connection-pool tuning (``ConnectionLimits``). ``None``
                (default) uses ``ConnectionLimits()`` defaults sized for
                typical batchexecute fan-out (max_connections=100,
                max_keepalive_connections=50, keepalive_expiry=30.0s). Widen
                for heavy batch workloads (FastAPI/Django services sharing one
                client across many concurrent requests).
            max_concurrent_uploads: Ceiling on simultaneous in-flight file
                uploads via ``client.sources.add_file``. Defaults to ``4``.
                ``None`` resolves to the default. See :class:`NotebookLMClient`
                for full semantics (FD-exhaustion guard, independence from
                the RPC pool).
            max_concurrent_rpcs: Ceiling on simultaneous in-flight RPC
                POSTs. Defaults to ``16``; ``None`` disables the gate.
                Must be ``>= 1`` and ``<= limits.max_connections``. See
                :class:`NotebookLMClient` for the cross-validation rule
                and the rationale (the gate sits below the connection
                pool so back-pressure surfaces cleanly instead of as
                opaque ``httpx.PoolTimeout``).
            upload_timeout: Optional override for the ``httpx.Timeout`` used
                by the resumable-upload start handshake and the finalize
                POST. ``None`` (default) preserves the original hardcoded
                values for back-compat. See :class:`NotebookLMClient` for
                full semantics.
            on_rpc_event: Optional sync or async callback invoked after each
                logical RPC succeeds or fails.

        Returns:
            NotebookLMClient instance (not yet connected).
