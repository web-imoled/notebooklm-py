"""Auth refresh coordinator helper for :class:`Session`.

Owns the auth refresh state machine and snapshot serialization that historically
lived inline on ``Session``:

* ``_refresh_lock`` — single-flight lock guarding refresh-task creation. Lazy
  because ``asyncio.Lock()`` needs a running loop in some Python versions and
  ``Session`` can be constructed outside one.
* ``_refresh_task`` — the shared in-flight refresh task. Slot is intentionally
  preserved across waiter cancellation so siblings can still join, and is
  replaced only on the next refresh wave once the existing task hits
  ``done()`` (see :meth:`await_refresh` docstring).
* ``_refresh_callback`` — the user-supplied async callable that performs the
  actual refresh. ``None`` disables refresh-on-401.
* ``_auth_snapshot_lock`` — serializes the four-scalar reads in
  :meth:`snapshot` with the two-scalar writes in :meth:`update_auth_tokens`
  so RPC snapshots cannot observe a torn ``(csrf, session_id)`` pair while
  refresh is in flight. Intentionally distinct from ``_refresh_lock``:
  mixing them would re-introduce the reentrancy ambiguity that
  snapshot-side serialization was added to avoid.

Design constraints (load-bearing — see tests/unit/test_refresh_*.py and
tests/integration/concurrency/test_refresh_cancellation_propagation.py):

* ``__init__`` MUST be event-loop-agnostic — it stores only a plain callable
  and ``None`` placeholders. Never call ``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` or
  instantiate ``asyncio.*`` primitives at construction time.
* :meth:`await_refresh` MUST hold no lock across ``await self._refresh_callback()``.
  The refresh lock gates *task creation* only; the await on the task itself
  happens outside the lock so other waiters can join. Mixing this contract
  would silently deadlock waiters on a slow callback.
* :meth:`update_auth_tokens` writes ONLY ``host.auth.csrf_token`` and
  ``host.auth.session_id`` under the snapshot lock. It does NOT touch the
  http client. The cookie-jar sync is a separate concern handled by
  :meth:`update_auth_headers` (sync, no await — it runs the
  ``host.get_http_client().cookies`` read outside any auth lock).
* The ``_refresh_task`` slot is intentionally NOT cleared when a waiter is
  cancelled mid-shield — concurrency tests assert task identity across
  cancellation so siblings joined to the same single-flight refresh see the
  same completion. Per ``_core.py`` history at the relocated comment site.
