# wrapper is only constructed when the env var resolves to a valid mode; the

#
# This is deliberately wired through the client's HTTP layer (not just the VCR
# config) so the substitution sits BELOW VCR — VCR records the synthetic
# response into the cassette as if it had come from the wire. Wiring it at the
# VCR-config layer only would mean the substitution never ran in record mode,

    Wraps an inner ``httpx.AsyncBaseTransport`` and substitutes a synthetic
    error response on outgoing batchexecute POSTs, built by
    ``tests.cassette_patterns.build_synthetic_error_response``. Non-batchexecute
    traffic (Scotty uploads, ``RotateCookies`` pokes, the homepage GET that
    extracts CSRF) passes through unchanged because none of those endpoints
    are in scope for error-shape cassettes.

    Substitution scope is controlled by ``always``:

    - ``always=True`` (the default for record-mode use): every batchexecute
      POST is substituted. This matters because the client's auth-refresh
      path re-issues the same RPC; we want the SAME error to fire on every
      retry inside the recording window so the cassette captures the full
      retry-and-fail sequence rather than substituting once and then letting
      a real response slip through on the retry.
    - ``always=False``: only the FIRST batchexecute POST is substituted; later
      POSTs fall through to the inner transport. Useful for tests that want
      to assert the client recovers after a single transient failure.

    This class is OPT-IN — ``ClientCore`` only wraps the transport when
    ``_get_error_injection_mode()`` returns a non-``None`` value, so removing
    the env var restores byte-for-byte production behavior.

                transport failures: HTTP 5xx responses and network-layer
                ``httpx.RequestError`` (timeouts, connect errors). Defaults to

                seconds — 5xx responses rarely carry ``Retry-After``, so the
                429 model doesn't apply. Set to ``0`` to disable. Refresh-path
                errors (400/401/403) are NOT covered here; those follow the
                existing auth-refresh-and-retry flow.

                max_keepalive_connections=50, keepalive_expiry=30.0). Pass an
                explicit ``ConnectionLimits(...)`` to widen the pool for
                heavy batch workloads (e.g. FastAPI/Django services that
                share one client across many concurrent requests).
            max_concurrent_uploads: Ceiling on simultaneous in-flight
                ``SourcesAPI.add_file`` uploads. Defaults to
                ``DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS`` (4). ``None`` resolves to
                the default — unbounded uploads are intentionally rejected
                because each in-flight upload holds one open file
                descriptor for the duration of the upload, and an
                unbounded fan-out exhausts the per-process FD limit. Must
                be ``>= 1`` when supplied. Independent
                of the RPC connection pool because uploads use their own
                ``httpx.AsyncClient`` (Scotty endpoint) and don't share
                the RPC pool.
            max_concurrent_rpcs: Ceiling on simultaneous in-flight
                ``_perform_authed_post`` RPC POSTs. Defaults to

                default httpx pool size (``max_connections=100``) so
                short-lived helper requests (refresh GETs, upload
                preflights) outside this gate still have pool headroom.
                Pass ``None`` to disable the gate entirely (callers with
                an external rate-limiter or single-shot CLI work).
                Must be ``>= 1`` when supplied. Before this gate was added,
                heavy fan-out workloads tripped opaque
                ``httpx.PoolTimeout`` errors before the connection pool
                could surface clean back-pressure. Cross-
                validation with ``limits.max_connections`` is enforced at
                the ``NotebookLMClient`` boundary (so the constraint
                applies whether ``limits`` is explicit or auto-defaulted
                inside ``ClientCore``).

          - The ``async with`` block in ``add_file`` covers FD-open,
            the two pre-upload RPCs (``_register_file_source`` and
            ``_start_resumable_upload``), and the streaming upload. The
            semaphore therefore also serializes those two RPCs — a side
            effect of the FD guard, not a separate quota.
          - The cap applies to the *blocking* ``add_file`` call. On
            post-finalize cancel, the shielded background
            ``finalize_task`` continues running with the FD still open
            after ``add_file``'s ``async with`` exits, so the
            instantaneous open-FD count can briefly exceed
            ``max_concurrent_uploads`` by the number of concurrently
            draining background tasks.

        Lazy construction is required because ``asyncio.Semaphore()`` in
        some Python versions binds to the running event loop at creation
        time, and ``ClientCore`` can be constructed outside any loop.
        Callers must invoke this from inside the loop where the upload
        will run — typically inside the ``async with`` block of
        ``add_file``.
