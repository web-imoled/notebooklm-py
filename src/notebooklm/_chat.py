def _extract_next_turn_content(next_turn: Any) -> str | None:
    """Extract the response content from a streaming-chat next_turn frame.

    The ``khqZz`` (``GET_CONVERSATION_TURNS``) response packs each AI answer
    as ``turn[4][0][0]`` — three nested wrappers around the answer text. This
    helper delegates the inner-most descent to :func:`safe_index`, which
    consults the strict-decode policy defined in :mod:`notebooklm._env`
    (``is_strict_decode_enabled``). Strict-decode is the default when
    ``NOTEBOOKLM_STRICT_DECODE`` is unset (or set to ``"1" / "true" / "True"``):
    descent failures raise :class:`~notebooklm.exceptions.UnknownRPCMethodError`
    so callers fail fast on Google-side shape drift. Setting
    ``NOTEBOOKLM_STRICT_DECODE=0`` (or any other non-truthy value) opts back
    into legacy soft-mode behavior — :func:`safe_index` logs a structured
    warning and returns ``None`` instead of raising. See ADR-011
    (``docs/adr/0011-schema-validation-policy.md``) for the rationale and
    the opt-out retirement timeline.

    Args:
        next_turn: The candidate answer turn (a ``turn[2] == 2`` row from the
            ``khqZz`` payload). Caller has already validated this is a list
            with ``len(next_turn) > 4`` and ``next_turn[2] == 2``.

    Returns:
        The answer-text string on success. ``None`` when the inner
        ``[4][0][0]`` chain drifts or the leaf is not a string — callers
        should fall back to an empty-answer pair so chat history rendering
        degrades gracefully rather than crashing.

                itself fails (transient network or auth issue). Same

            # New conversation — SDK fetches the real id post-ask via hPTbtc.
            result = await client.chat.ask(notebook_id, "What is machine learning?")
