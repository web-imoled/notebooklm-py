"""Module-level constants for the NotebookLM session client.

Holds the ``DEFAULT_*`` knobs that historically lived in :mod:`notebooklm._session`'s
preamble. Each constant is re-exported from :mod:`notebooklm._session` so existing
``from notebooklm._session import DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`` imports keep working.

These values are tuned for typical interactive workloads; see each docstring
below for guidance on when an operator would want to override them via the
:class:`~notebooklm.NotebookLMClient` constructor kwargs.
