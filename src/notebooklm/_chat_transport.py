"""Chat-domain consumer-side error-mapping seam over generic transport.

This module owns the chat-flavored exception mapping that wraps a
single authed POST attempt against the NotebookLM batchexecute
endpoint. It is the chat-domain consumer-side seam: transport-layer
exceptions (``TransportAuthExpired``, ``TransportRateLimited``,
``TransportServerError``, raw ``httpx.HTTPStatusError``) raised by
``Session._perform_authed_post`` are translated into ``ChatError``
or ``NetworkError`` so callers (currently only :class:`ChatAPI.ask`)
stay free of HTTP-status branching.

After the D2 cutover (PR-2 / arch-d2-cutover), :meth:`ChatAPI.ask`
calls :func:`chat_aware_authed_post` directly, replacing the prior
chat-side wrapper that lived on the core's RPC executor.

    ChatAPI free of HTTP-status branching and matches the historical
