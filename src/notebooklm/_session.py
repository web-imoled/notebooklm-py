        Args:
            auth: Authentication tokens from browser login.
            timeout: HTTP request timeout in seconds. Defaults to 30 seconds.
                This applies to read/write operations after connection is established.
            connect_timeout: Connection establishment timeout in seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.
                A shorter connect timeout helps detect network issues faster.
            refresh_callback: Optional async callback to refresh auth tokens on failure.
                If provided, rpc_call will automatically retry once after refreshing.
            refresh_retry_delay: Delay in seconds before retrying after refresh.
            keepalive: Optional interval in seconds for a background task that pokes
                ``accounts.google.com/RotateCookies`` while the client is open. ``None``
                (default) disables the task. Must be ``None`` or a positive finite
                number; values below ``keepalive_min_interval`` are clamped up to
                that floor.
            keepalive_min_interval: Lower bound for ``keepalive`` (defaults to 60s)
                to avoid accidentally rate-limiting Google's identity surface.
                Must be a positive finite number.
            keepalive_storage_path: Optional storage path to persist rotated cookies
                to from the keepalive loop. Falls back to ``auth.storage_path``.
            rate_limit_max_retries: Max automatic retries on HTTP 429.
                Defaults to ``3`` so programmatic users
                inherit "smart retry" behavior without having to opt in. Set
                to ``0`` to raise ``RateLimitError`` immediately. Each retry
                sleeps for the
                ``Retry-After`` value when the server provides a parseable
                header (clamped at ``MAX_RETRY_AFTER_SECONDS``); when the
                header is absent or unparseable, the loop falls back to
                capped exponential backoff ``min(2 ** attempt, 30)`` seconds
                with ±20% jitter, matching the 5xx path so the positive
                default is still useful when Google omits the hint.
            server_error_max_retries: Max automatic retries for retryable transient
                transport failures: HTTP 5xx responses and network-layer
                ``httpx.RequestError`` (timeouts, connect errors). Defaults to
                ``3``. Uses exponential backoff ``min(2 ** attempt, 30)``
                seconds — 5xx responses rarely carry ``Retry-After``, so the
                429 model doesn't apply. Set to ``0`` to disable. Refresh-path
                errors (400/401/403) are NOT covered here; those follow the
                existing auth-refresh-and-retry flow.
            limits: HTTP connection-pool tuning (``ConnectionLimits``). ``None``
                (default) constructs a ``ConnectionLimits()`` with defaults
                sized for typical batchexecute fan-out (max_connections=100,
                max_keepalive_connections=50, keepalive_expiry=30.0). Pass an
                explicit ``ConnectionLimits(...)`` to widen the pool for
                heavy batch workloads (e.g. FastAPI/Django services that
                share one client across many concurrent requests).
            max_concurrent_uploads: Ceiling on simultaneous in-flight
                ``SourcesAPI.add_file`` uploads. Defaults to
                ``DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS`` (4). ``None`` resolves to
                the default — unbounded uploads are intentionally rejected
                because each in-flight upload holds one open file
                descriptor for the duration of the upload, and an
                unbounded fan-out exhausts the per-process FD limit. Must
                be ``>= 1`` when supplied. Independent
                of the RPC connection pool because uploads use their own
                ``httpx.AsyncClient`` (Scotty endpoint) and don't share
                the RPC pool.
            max_concurrent_rpcs: Ceiling on simultaneous in-flight
                ``_perform_authed_post`` RPC POSTs. Defaults to
                ``DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_RPCS`` (16) — well below the
                default httpx pool size (``max_connections=100``) so
                short-lived helper requests (refresh GETs, upload
                preflights) outside this gate still have pool headroom.
                Pass ``None`` to disable the gate entirely (callers with
                an external rate-limiter or single-shot CLI work).
                Must be ``>= 1`` when supplied. Before this gate was added,
                heavy fan-out workloads tripped opaque
                ``httpx.PoolTimeout`` errors before the connection pool
                could surface clean back-pressure. Cross-
                validation with ``limits.max_connections`` is enforced at
                the ``NotebookLMClient`` boundary (so the constraint
                applies whether ``limits`` is explicit or auto-defaulted
                inside ``Session``).
            on_rpc_event: Optional callback invoked after each logical
                ``rpc_call`` succeeds or fails. The callback receives a
                backend-agnostic :class:`RpcTelemetryEvent`; exceptions raised
                by the callback are logged and never mask the RPC result.
            cookie_saver: Optional injectable seam (Phase 2 PR 3) overriding
                the on-disk cookie writer used by
                :meth:`ClientLifecycle.save_cookies`. ``None`` (default)
                resolves to :func:`_default_cookie_saver`, which late-binds
                to ``notebooklm._auth.storage.save_cookies_to_storage`` so
                the canonical-seam monkeypatch surface keeps affecting the
                live path. Must be sync (``def``, not ``async def``) — it
                runs inside ``asyncio.to_thread``. Custom callables bypass
                the late-bind hop entirely.
            cookie_rotator: Optional injectable seam (Phase 2 PR 3)
                overriding the keepalive-loop rotator. ``None`` (default)
                resolves to :func:`_default_cookie_rotator`, which late-binds
                to ``notebooklm._auth.keepalive._rotate_cookies``. Must be
                async — it is awaited from :meth:`ClientLifecycle._keepalive_loop`.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If ``keepalive`` or ``keepalive_min_interval`` is not a

        dataclass fields stay unpopulated through Tier-12 — middlewares
        in PRs 12.3–12.9 carried behavior out of :class:`AuthedTransport`
        but the leaf still rebuilds the request from ``build_request`` +
        ``AuthSnapshot`` rather than reading the dataclass fields.
        Population is deferred to Tier-13 row 13.2 (``Kernel.post``
        rewrite) — see ADR-009 close-out notes §"AuthRefreshMiddleware
        shipped without rebuild closures". See ADR-009
        §"RpcRequest.context keys" for the metadata vocabulary.

        (``RPCMethod.name``) for RPC callers and ``None`` for the chat
        streaming path. ``MetricsMiddleware`` reads it from
        ``request.context["rpc_method"]`` to populate
        :attr:`RpcTelemetryEvent.method` and to decide whether to fire the
        emission at all — chat-side callers that pass ``None`` skip emission,
        matching the pre-chain behavior (where ``_chat_transport`` never
        called ``_emit_rpc_event``).
