"""Transport drain bookkeeping helper for :class:`Session`.

Owns the in-flight transport-operation counters, the lazy
``asyncio.Condition`` that ``drain()`` parks on, the per-``asyncio.Task``
operation-depth map, and the ``_draining`` flag. Lifted out of ``_session.py``
so the drain surface has one home (this file) instead of being woven into
``Session.__init__`` alongside metrics, reqid, and auth state.

Design constraints (load-bearing — see
``tests/unit/concurrency/test_close_cancellation_leak.py``,
``tests/unit/test_session_close.py``, and ``tests/unit/test_observability.py``):

* ``__init__`` MUST be event-loop-agnostic. ``Session`` is routinely
  constructed outside a running loop (sync-mode
  ``NotebookLMClient(auth)`` before ``asyncio.run``), so this helper may
  not call ``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` or instantiate any ``asyncio.*``
  primitive at construction time. The ``asyncio.Condition`` is created
  lazily on first :meth:`get_drain_condition` call from inside a running
  loop.

* :meth:`drain` blocks on ``self._drain_condition`` while
  ``_in_flight_posts > 0``. The ``Condition.wait_for`` pattern is the
  whole point of the helper — never replace it with a poll loop.

* :meth:`begin_transport_post` rejects new top-level work once
  ``_draining`` is set, but allows nested begins from a task whose
  outer operation was admitted *before* the drain started (depth > 0).
  This is what ``test_drain_allows_nested_work_inside_accepted_operation``
  pins down; the depth bookkeeping under the condition lock is exactly
  what stops the close path from deadlocking.

* Exceptions during :meth:`finish_transport_post` would orphan a
  counter and stall ``drain`` forever — keep the body trivial and
  fully inside the ``async with condition`` block.

Field names are deliberately the same as the legacy ``Session`` ivars
(``_in_flight_posts``, ``_draining``, ``_drain_condition``) so the
surviving compat ``@property`` bridges on ``Session`` can delegate via
``return self._drain_tracker._<attr>`` and stay readable. The
``_operation_depths`` compat bridge on ``Session`` was dropped in
D1-audit-full once its callers migrated; the field itself remains on
``TransportDrainTracker`` because the drain bookkeeping needs it.
