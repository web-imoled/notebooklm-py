"""AuthRefreshMiddleware — 401/403/400-CSRF retry-with-refresh for the chain.

Per ADR-009 §"Chain ordering", ``AuthRefreshMiddleware`` sits just *inside*
``RetryMiddleware`` and just *outside* ``ErrorInjectionMiddleware``. The final
Tier-12 chain (post-PR 12.9, after ``SemaphoreMiddleware`` was inserted between
``Metrics`` and ``Retry``) is
``[Drain, Metrics, Semaphore, Retry, AuthRefresh, ErrorInjection, Tracing]`` —
PR 12.8 inserts ``AuthRefresh`` between ``Retry`` and ``ErrorInjection`` so
this ordering is now realized end-to-end.

This middleware owns the **auth-refresh-once retry** loop. The leaf is a
*pure* ``Kernel.post`` terminal that lets ``httpx.HTTPStatusError`` /
``httpx.RequestError`` propagate raw for auth errors (the 429 / 5xx mapping
stays at the terminal since it feeds ``RetryMiddleware``). The middleware
catches the raw auth-error ``httpx.HTTPStatusError``, triggers a coalesced
refresh via :class:`AuthRefreshCoordinator`, rebuilds the request envelope,
then re-invokes ``next_call`` exactly once.

Why "exactly once": ADR-009 §"Retry semantics" pins
"**exactly one** retry per ``next_call`` invocation. If the retry also
raises 401, the exception propagates — no second retry, no recursion."
``RetryMiddleware`` outside this middleware does NOT retry on auth
errors (it catches only ``TransportRateLimited`` /
``TransportServerError``), so a persistent 401 surfaces cleanly to the
caller without burning the rate-limit / server-error budget on auth
loops.

Refresh-failure path: if the refresh callback itself raises (network
flake, login expired, etc.), the middleware wraps the original
``httpx.HTTPStatusError`` in :class:`TransportAuthExpired` so callers
that key on the transport exception type still see a coherent shape.
Matches the pre-PR-12.8 leaf-side ``TransportAuthExpired`` raise.

Pre-refresh sleep: when ``refresh_retry_delay > 0`` the middleware sleeps
that duration AFTER the successful refresh and BEFORE the retry. This
preserves the historical transport behavior so a cassette that recorded the
post-refresh delay replays the same timing.

Request-materialization transition: ``Session`` now enters the chain with
the initial ``RpcRequest.url`` / ``.headers`` / ``.body`` populated and the
terminal consumes that envelope through ``Kernel.post``. After a successful
refresh this middleware re-snapshots auth state and replaces the request
envelope before retrying so the terminal never sends stale URL/body/header
values.

This regression-fix from PR 12.7 also closes here: pre-PR-12.7 the leaf's
``refreshed_this_call`` lived in the same loop as 429/5xx retries (one
refresh max per logical call). PR 12.7 split the loops, leaving each
``RetryMiddleware`` retry to spawn a fresh leaf invocation with its own
``refreshed_this_call`` — up to N refreshes per call. PR 12.8 collapses
this back: refresh is now a chain-level concern, ``RetryMiddleware`` is
unaware of refreshes, and the once-per-call contract is restored by the
fact that ``AuthRefreshMiddleware`` only retries ONCE per ``next_call``
invocation.

See ``docs/adr/0009-middleware-chain.md`` for the chain contract,
``src/notebooklm/_session_auth.py`` for :class:`AuthRefreshCoordinator`
(coalesced refresh + auth-snapshot lock), and
``.sisyphus/plans/tier-12-13-greenfield-migration.md`` row 12.8 for the
PR sequence.

    """Chain middleware that retries authed POSTs once after refreshing tokens.

    Conforms to :class:`notebooklm._middleware.Middleware` — ``__call__``
    matches the Protocol so instances are assignable into a
    ``Sequence[Middleware]``.

    Constructor inputs (all wired by ``Session.__init__``):

    - ``refresh_callable``: a zero-arg async callable that drives one
      coalesced auth refresh. Production wires
      ``lambda: Session._await_refresh(self)`` which delegates to
      :meth:`AuthRefreshCoordinator.await_refresh`. The middleware never
      reaches into the coordinator directly; this keeps the seam thin
      and testable.
    - ``is_auth_error``: predicate that decides whether an exception is
      an auth failure (HTTP 400 / 401 / 403). Production wires
      :func:`notebooklm._session_helpers.is_auth_error` through a lambda
      that resolves it via the canonical module's globals at call time,
      so ``monkeypatch.setattr("notebooklm._session_helpers.is_auth_error",
      ...)`` reaches the chain live; tests that build the middleware
      directly typically pass the function itself.
    - ``refresh_callback_enabled``: a zero-arg callable returning ``True``
      iff a refresh callback is wired on the host. Production wires
      ``lambda: self._auth_coord._refresh_callback is not None`` so a
      client built without ``refresh_callback`` skips the refresh path
      entirely (matches the legacy leaf gate on
      ``host._refresh_callback is not None``).
    - ``refresh_retry_delay``: zero-arg callable returning the
      post-refresh sleep duration. Production wires
      ``lambda: self._refresh_retry_delay`` so a test that mutates the
      attr on the live client still takes effect (matches the live-binding
      contract preserved for retry budgets in PR 12.7).
    - ``snapshot_provider``: optional async callable returning a fresh
      :class:`AuthSnapshot` after refresh. Production wires
      :meth:`Session._snapshot`; tests that omit it preserve the older
      "retry the same request" unit shape.
    - ``sleep``: optional sleep injection (defaults to :func:`asyncio.sleep`
      resolved at call time via :func:`_session_helpers.resolve_sleep` —
      the same shared helper :class:`RetryMiddleware` uses).
    - ``logger``: structured logger for the "auth error detected" /
      "refresh successful" / "refresh failed" info / warning lines.
      Defaults to the project-canonical ``notebooklm._core`` logger so
      ``caplog.at_level(..., logger="notebooklm._core")`` keeps matching.
    - ``metrics``: a :class:`ClientMetrics` whose ``increment(...)`` is
      called once per successful refresh (matches the legacy
      ``host._increment_metrics(rpc_auth_retries=1)`` site).

        Tracks ``context["auth_refreshed"]`` to enforce **at most one
        refresh per logical call** even when ``RetryMiddleware`` (outside
        this middleware) re-invokes the chain on a 429/5xx that fires
        after a successful refresh. Without this flag the sequence
        ``401 → refresh → 429 → Retry retry → 401`` would refresh twice
        (codex iter-1 catch on PR 12.8). With it, the second 401
        propagates without a redundant refresh, matching the pre-PR-12.7

        4. If the refresh callable itself raises, wrap in
           ``TransportAuthExpired(original=exc)`` and propagate.
        5. Optional post-refresh sleep (``refresh_retry_delay``).
        6. Increment ``rpc_auth_retries`` metric.
        7. Rebuild the request envelope when a ``snapshot_provider`` and
           ``context["build_request"]`` are available.
        8. Re-invoke ``next_call(retry_request)`` — exactly once. If the
           retry also raises, propagate unchanged (no second refresh,
           no recursion).
