"""Type-only scaffolding for the Tier-12 middleware chain.

This module ships in PR 12.1 of the Tier-12/13 greenfield migration. It
defines:

- :class:`RpcRequest` / :class:`RpcResponse` — the HTTP-shape envelopes the
  chain passes around (NOT RPC-shape; encoding/decoding lives above the
  chain in ``Session.rpc_call``).
- :data:`NextCall` — the call-the-next-link type alias used by middlewares
  and by the chain builder.
- :class:`Middleware` — the ``Protocol`` every middleware satisfies. Around-
  style: each middleware receives the request and a ``next_call`` callable;
  it decides whether (and how) to invoke ``next_call(request)``, optionally
  observing or transforming the response.
- :func:`materialize_rpc_request` — converts the legacy ``BuildRequest``
  callback shape into the future populated ``RpcRequest`` envelope.
- :func:`build_chain` — composes a ``Sequence[Middleware]`` around a terminal
  ``NextCall`` so the leftmost middleware in the sequence becomes the
  *outermost* wrapper (matches the ordering documented in ADR-009).

Production ``Session`` wiring composes these envelopes through the current
middleware stack. During the request-materialization migration, the chain
enters with populated ``RpcRequest(url, headers, body)`` fields and the
terminal consumes that envelope directly through ``Kernel.post``. See
``docs/adr/0009-middleware-chain.md`` for the load-bearing decisions.

    - Observe the request before calling ``next_call`` (logging, metrics).
    - Transform the request via :func:`dataclasses.replace` and pass the new
      one to ``next_call`` (auth refresh).
    - Wrap ``next_call`` in a try/except to handle specific exceptions
      (retry, auth refresh).
    - Observe or transform the response after ``next_call`` returns
      (metrics, tracing).
    - Short-circuit (return without calling ``next_call``). Used only by
      error-injection middlewares in tests; not by any production
      middleware in the Tier-12 set.

def build_chain(

    """Compose ``middlewares`` around ``terminal`` and return the outer call.

    Ordering contract: the **first** middleware in the sequence becomes the
    **outermost** wrapper around ``terminal``. With
    ``middlewares = [A, B, C]`` and ``terminal = T``, the returned callable
    invokes ``A.__call__(request, →B)`` where ``→B`` invokes
    ``B.__call__(request, →C)`` where ``→C`` invokes
    ``C.__call__(request, →T)``.

    This matches the chain ordering documented in ADR-009: ``[Drain,
    Metrics, Retry, AuthRefresh, ErrorInjection, Tracing]`` — Drain at
    index 0 is the outermost wrapper, Tracing at index 5 is the innermost
    wrapper around the terminal.

    Implementation: wrap in reverse, so the last middleware in the sequence
    is composed first (it becomes the innermost wrapper, with ``terminal``
    as its ``next_call``), then each earlier middleware wraps the chain
    built so far. ``make_wrapper`` is a defensive idiom that captures
    ``mw`` and ``next_call`` in its own function scope (one set of
    bindings per call) rather than letting the inner ``wrapped`` close
    over the loop variable — without it, every wrapper in a Python loop
    would close over the *final* value of the loop variable.

    The returned :data:`NextCall` is safe to invoke concurrently from
    multiple tasks: the chain itself is stateless, and each middleware's
    state (if any) is its own concern. Returning a fresh chain per
    ``build_chain`` call also means tests can build per-test chains
    without leaking state across tests.

    An empty ``middlewares`` sequence returns ``terminal`` unchanged.
