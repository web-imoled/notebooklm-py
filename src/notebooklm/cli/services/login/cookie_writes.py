"""Cookie write + account-selection helpers.

Owns the path that persists extracted cookies to ``storage_state.json``
(``_write_extracted_cookies``) and the two account-selection helpers
(``_select_account`` for the ``--browser-cookies``-driven targeted
extraction, ``_select_refresh_account`` for the refresh-from-cached path).

No in-package imports today. The DAG
(``test_login_package_dag.py``) allows edges to :mod:`.browser_accounts`
and :mod:`.cookie_domains` for future use, but neither is currently
needed: ``_write_extracted_cookies`` and the selectors operate on
already-loaded cookie data + already-discovered accounts, and the
selectors do not need to query the cookie-domain policy themselves.
