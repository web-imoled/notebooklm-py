"""Refresh + bulk-login drivers + post-login server-language sync.

Top of the leaf-ward DAG: imports from :mod:`.browser_accounts`,
:mod:`.cookie_writes`, and :mod:`.profile_targets`. Owns:

- ``_login_browser_cookies_single`` — extract one account into a profile.
- ``_login_all_accounts_from_browser`` — extract every signed-in account.
- ``_login_with_browser_cookies`` — single-jar default-account login.
- ``_refresh_from_browser_cookies`` — repair account drift for the
  active profile.
- ``_sync_server_language_to_config`` — fetch server language setting
  after login and persist locally. **Legacy import path preservation:**
  37+ patch sites monkeypatch ``notebooklm.cli.session_cmd._sync_server_language_to_config``.
  The session module's ``from .services.login import _sync_server_language_to_config``
  resolves via the package's ``__init__.py`` re-export of this function.
