"""Shared cookie-jar enumeration helper.

Contains :func:`_enumerate_one_jar` — probes one rookiepy cookie set
against ``?authuser=N`` to return tagged :class:`Account` records. Both
the legacy single-jar path (``_read_browser_cookies``) and the Chromium
multi-profile fan-out path call this helper.

Also owns :data:`_ROOKIEPY_BROWSER_ALIASES` — the user-facing browser
name → rookiepy function-name map (referenced by
:mod:`.browser_accounts._read_browser_cookies` for the named-browser
dispatch path).

No in-package imports today. The DAG (``test_login_package_dag.py``)
allows an edge to :mod:`.rookiepy_errors` for future use, but
``_enumerate_one_jar`` currently formats its own error messages and does
not call :func:`.rookiepy_errors._handle_rookiepy_error`. This module
relies on the auth-side helpers for cookie shape conversion.

    Shared by both the legacy single-jar path and the chromium multi-profile
    fan-out path. ``browser_profile`` annotates the resulting Accounts so the
    fan-out caller can route writes back to the right source.

    Args:
        raw_cookies: rookiepy cookie dicts for one source.
        browser_name: The browser the cookies came from (for error messages).
        browser_profile: Tag attached to each Account (``"Default"``,
            ``"Profile 1"``, ...) or ``None`` for the legacy single-jar path.
        quiet: Suppress the loud multi-line user-facing error panels
            (``"No valid Google authentication cookies"``, ``"Account
            discovery failed: …stale"``) for "this profile is signed out"
            cases and just raise ``SystemExit``. Used by the fan-out caller,
            which prints its own per-profile soft note for signed-out /
            stale-cookie profiles and would otherwise bleed those panels into
            the table output. Network errors (``httpx.RequestError``) are
            NOT downgraded — they propagate as-is so the caller can
            distinguish transport failures from per-profile "signed out".

    Raises:
        SystemExit: On missing required cookies or stale-cookie rejection
            by Google (Google redirected to the account chooser, etc.).
            These are per-profile "signed out" conditions in fan-out mode
            and are caught and skipped by the fan-out caller.
        httpx.RequestError: On network transport failure. Re-raised
            unchanged so the fan-out aborts (vs. silently downgrading every
            offline profile to a soft skip).
