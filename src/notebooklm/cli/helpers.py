def with_client(f):
    """Decorator that handles auth, async execution, and errors for CLI commands.

    This decorator eliminates boilerplate from commands that need:
    - Authentication (get AuthTokens from context)
    - Async execution (run coroutine with asyncio.run)
    - Error handling (auth errors, general exceptions)

    The decorated function stays SYNC (Click doesn't support async) but returns
    a coroutine. The decorator runs the coroutine and handles errors.

    Usage:
        @cli.command("list")
        @click.option("--json", "json_output", is_flag=True)
        @with_client
        def list_notebooks(ctx, json_output, client_auth):
            async def _run():
                async with NotebookLMClient(client_auth) as client:
                    notebooks = await client.notebooks.list()
                    output_notebooks(notebooks, json_output)
            return _run()

    Args:
        f: Function that accepts client_auth (AuthTokens) and returns a coroutine

    Returns:
        Decorated function with Click pass_context
