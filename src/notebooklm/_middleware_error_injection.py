"""ErrorInjectionMiddleware — synthetic-error short-circuit for the Tier-12 chain.

Per ADR-009 §"Chain ordering", ``ErrorInjectionMiddleware`` sits just *inside*
``RetryMiddleware`` / ``AuthRefreshMiddleware`` (which extract in PRs 12.7–12.8)
and just *outside* ``TracingMiddleware``. The final Tier-12 chain (post-PR 12.9,
after ``SemaphoreMiddleware`` was inserted between ``Metrics`` and ``Retry``) is
``[Drain, Metrics, Semaphore, Retry, AuthRefresh, ErrorInjection, Tracing]``. PR 12.6 ships
the interim 4-middleware chain ``[Drain, Metrics, ErrorInjection, Tracing]``;
PRs 12.7–12.8 insert ``Retry`` and ``AuthRefresh`` BETWEEN ``Metrics`` and
``ErrorInjection`` so the ordering rationale holds at every step.

Test-only path. Production behavior is unchanged when ``NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD_ERRORS``
is unset — the middleware delegates straight to ``next_call``. When the env var
resolves to ``"429"`` / ``"5xx"`` / ``"expired_csrf"`` (via
:func:`_error_injection._get_error_injection_mode`), every chain invocation
short-circuits with a synthetic :class:`httpx.Response` built by
``tests/cassette_patterns.build_synthetic_error_response`` — the chain leaf
(``_perform_authed_post``) is NOT called. The same env-var startup guard
(:func:`_error_injection._refuse_synthetic_error_outside_test_context`)
still fires at ``Session`` construction so a leaked deploy env never reaches
this code path in production.

Tier-12 history: PR 12.6 lifted the substitution from the pre-Tier-12
httpx transport (``_error_injection._SyntheticErrorTransport``,
which wrapped ``httpx.AsyncClient`` in ``ClientLifecycle``) into this
middleware. PR 12.9 deleted the legacy transport class outright; this
middleware is now the only production substitution surface.

Behavior contract:

- Env var unset → ``await next_call(request)`` unchanged (pass-through).
- Env var set, mode ``"429"`` → raise :class:`TransportRateLimited` so the
  OUTER ``RetryMiddleware`` retries (restoring ADR-009 §"ErrorInjection
  inside Retry — synthetic transient failures trigger retry"; codex iter-1
  catch on PR 12.7). The raised exception carries the synthetic
  ``Retry-After`` header so the retry honors the rate-limit timing.
- Env var set, mode ``"5xx"`` → raise :class:`TransportServerError` so
  ``RetryMiddleware`` retries with exponential backoff.
- Env var set, mode ``"expired_csrf"`` (HTTP 400) → raise the raw
  :class:`httpx.HTTPStatusError` so ``AuthRefreshMiddleware`` (outside
  this middleware in the final chain ordering) catches it via
  ``is_auth_error`` and drives the refresh-then-retry flow. Pre-PR-12.6
  this happened naturally because the legacy ``_SyntheticErrorTransport``
  returned the synthetic 400 below httpx, the leaf's ``raise_for_status``
  lifted it into an ``HTTPStatusError``, and the leaf's auth-refresh
  branch handled it. PR 12.8 restores that end-to-end (codex iter-1
  catch on PR 12.8).

All raised exceptions wrap a synthetic :class:`httpx.Response` anchored to
``request.url`` / ``request.headers`` / ``request.body`` so callers
inspecting ``response.request`` see what the leaf would have sent.

Restored retry semantics: pre-PR-12.6 the httpx-layer
:class:`_SyntheticErrorTransport` fired on *every* batchexecute POST,
including the ones ``AuthedTransport.perform_authed_post`` re-issued from
its internal retry loop. PR 12.6 lifted the middleware above the leaf,
which broke that. PR 12.7 added ``RetryMiddleware`` OUTSIDE this
middleware AND has this middleware raise the proper transport exceptions
for 429/5xx so the outer retry actually fires. Each retry re-enters this
middleware, which re-raises — matching the pre-PR-12.6 "every retry
re-fires the synthetic error" behavior bit-for-bit.

See ``docs/adr/0009-middleware-chain.md`` for the chain contract,
``src/notebooklm/_error_injection.py`` for the env-var / startup-guard
helpers, and ``docs/refactor-history.md`` for the migration sequence.
